# kadena_connect API

## Abstract

This KIP standardizes the `kadena_connect` method for establishing a connection between decentralized applications (dApps) and Kadena wallets. The method handles user authorization and returns active account information, providing a consistent interface for wallet connectivity across the Kadena ecosystem.

## Motivation

Inconsistent connection methods across various wallet implementations lead to fragmented user experiences and increased integration complexity for dApps. Standardizing `kadena_connect` will:

- Unify connection workflows across all Kadena wallets.
- Simplify dApp integration with predictable method signatures.
- Enable silent reconnection for returning users.
- Provide clear error reporting for connection failures.

## Specification

### Method Definition

**Method Name:** `kadena_connect`

### Request Parameters

```typescript
interface ConnectRequest {
  silent?: boolean // Optional: Attempt silent authentication without UI prompts.
  networkId: string // Required: Network ID (e.g., "mainnet01", "testnet04")
}
```

Response

The method returns an AccountInfo object containing the connected account’s details:

```typescript
interface AccountInfo {
  accountName: string // Unique account identifier.
  fungibleContract: string // Identifier for the fungible token contract.
  chainAccounts?: Array<{
    chainId: string // Chain identifier within the network.
    guard: {
      keys: Array<{ publicKey: string }> // Array of public keys (secret keys omitted for security).
      pred: string // Predicate defining key validation (e.g., "keys-all", "keys-any").
    }
  }>
}
```

Error Responses

In case of failure, the wallet MUST return an error in the following structure:

```typescript
{
  "error": {
    "type": "reject | noAccounts | networkUnsupported | other",
    "msg": string | null
  }
}
```

Behavior Requirements

1. User Consent:
   • MUST display connection details unless silent: true and prior consent exists.
   • MUST persist consent only after explicit user approval.
2. Network Handling:
   • MUST validate the provided networkId against supported networks.
   • MUST return a networkUnsupported error if the network is invalid.
3. Cryptographic Safety:
   • MUST NOT expose secret keys.
   • MUST return public keys in a secure, standardized format.
4. Event Emission:
   • SHOULD emit a kadena_accountChanged event after a successful connection.
   • SHOULD emit a kadena_networkChanged event if a network switch occurs during the connection process.

# Examples

## Basic Connection Request

### Request

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "kadena_connect",
  "params": {
    "networkId": "mainnet01"
  }
}
```

### Success Response

```json
{
  "accountName": "k:abc123...",
  "fungibleContract": "ft:xyz456...",
  "chainAccounts": [
    {
      "chainId": "0",
      "guard": {
        "keys": [
          {
            "publicKey": "ae18efd16cbd49e9a92552a2589ac01491b486fbcbb1e3f07980f945597e2033"
          }
        ],
        "pred": "keys-all"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Silent Reconnection Attempt

### Request

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "kadena_connect",
  "params": {
    "silent": true,
    "networkId": "testnet04"
  }
}
```

### Error Response

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "noAccounts",
    "msg": "No previously connected account found for network testnet04"
  }
}
```

Backwards Compatibility
• Legacy Methods: Wallets MAY support deprecated connection methods alongside kadena_connect. Legacy methods MUST be documented as deprecated and phased out over time.
• Network Fallback: Implementations MUST handle unsupported or invalid networkId values by returning an appropriate error.

Security Considerations
• Silent Mode Safeguards: Wallets MUST implement session expiration for silent reconnections. Automatic reconnections MUST require prior explicit consent.
• Phishing Protection: Wallets MUST display the requesting dApp’s domain during the initial connection and validate TLS certificates in web-based environments.
