## Abstract

Define and implement a Pact interface to provide a multi-token, "poly-fungible" standard, drawing inspiration
from ERC-1155 and related token standards. A poly-fungible allows a single module to represent fungible,
non-fungible, or "semi-fungible" assets, by being able to differentiate assets by an identifier,
within which fungibility is distinctly specified.


## Motivation

Immediate inspiration comes from the ERC-1155 "multi-token" standard, which reflects the attractive feature
that a single module can represent
unlimited tokens. As attractive as that is for developers, future Pact versions will support _implicit
arguments_ to allow a single module to present a `fungible-v2` single-token interface for multiple
assets, so "multi-token" is not a motivator in itself.

Instead, it is the plasticity of fungibility that adds the most value, for "NFT" use-cases that want
to issue some kind of fractional ownership or series. Here is where poly-fungible shines, by following
the Pact practice of denominating in decimal values with a precision indicator. Where ERC-1155 works only
in integer quanta, a poly-fungible can achieve this with a 0-value `precision`, but can also offer
truly "fractional" ownership with higher precisions.

## Rationale

### DISCUSSION: specify a receiver interface.

Not clear that in Pact so-called "safe transfers" are relevant, or that an autonomous receiver API
shouldn't be subscription-based by the smart contract in question (via a Pact feature to receive events).

### DISCUSSION: include ERC-1155 URI.

This might be important for interop with ERC-1155, especially if there are in-practice usages for
things like image URIs.

### DISCUSSION: no aggregations

Confirm that total-supply and other features (which actually are NOT in ERC-1155 and
rationalized so) are not needed.

## Backwards Compatibility

Given the similarity to Kadenaswap's `tokens.pact` module there is some effort to not change argument
names etc. Thus `"token"` instead of `"id"` for instance. This is still up for discussion though.

## Specification

- Interface: [poly-fungible-v1.pact](poly-fungible-v1.pact)
- Reference implementation: [poly-fungible-reference.pact](poly-fungible-reference.pact)
- Test: [poly-fungible-test.repl](poly-fungible-test.repl)
