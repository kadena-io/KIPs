## Abstract

Improve the KIP-0013 [poly-fungible-v2](https://github.com/kadena-io/KIPs/blob/master/kip-0013/kip-0013.md) standard to encompass

- a) Composable Token Policies
- b) Offchain token metadata URI

## Motivation

`poly-fungible-v2` enabled addition of customized rules like royalties through `policy` model and `manifest` model to store any form of data. However, it lacked a standardized method of managing these tokens. In order to solve these problems, `poly-fungible-v3` seeks to standardize the most used features by allowing composable `token-policies`, and offchain metadata standard.

### Token Policies

`poly-fungible-v3` stores `token-policies` per token, instead of a single `policy` in `poly-fungible-v2`.

In marmalade-v2, policy manager acts as a middleware between policies, mapping over saved policies to run the `policy::enforce-**` functions.

Marmalade V2 aims to make token creation simple and convenient, yet still offer the rich features using concrete-policies. A concrete policy is a simple basic implementation of some of the most used features in token creation.
We provide 4 concrete policies, which will provide the most used functionalities.

- **Guard Policy**: Initiates a guard with each marmalade activities. The guards are optional, but mint guards are recommended to prevent foreign entity from minting the created tokens.
- **Collection Policy**: Initiates a collection with pre-defined token lists
- **Non-fungible Policy**: Defines the token supply to 1 and precision of 0, so the token becomes non-fungible
- **Royalty-policy**: Registers creator account to receive royalty payout whenever token us sold using policy-manager's "quotes"

Marmalade users can mint tokens with above features by crafting a list using helper functions, or by manually creating a list of token policies, [module{kip.token-policy-v2}]. The concrete policies are defined in side `marmalade-v2.policy-manager`

## Marmalade Functions

### Create Token

A Token is created in marmalade via running `create-token`. This step is a crucial part of marmalade token life cycle that registers the rules of the token, but because it is specific to marmalade and not all ledgers may require the step, the function is taken out of `poly-fungible-v3`. kadena-io/marmalade#125

Arguments include:

- `id`: token-id, formatted in `t:{token-detail-hash}`. Should be created using `create-token-id`. The id hashes `uri`, `precision`, `policies`, and `creation-guard`.
- `precision`: Number of decimals allowed for for the token amount. For one-off token, precision must be 0, and should be enforced in the policy's `enforce-init`.
- `uri`: url to external JSON containing metadata
- `policies`: policies contract with custom functions that execute during marmalade functions
- `creation-guard`: Addition of `creation-guard` in the token-hash, and requiring its signature at creation prevents front-running of the token creation.

`policy-manager.enforce-init` calls `policy:enforce-init` in stored token-policies, and the function is executed in `ledger.create-token`.


### Mint Token

Token amount is minted to an account at `mint`. Arguments include:

- `id`: token-id
- `account`: account that will receive the minted token
- `guard`: guard of the minted account
- `amount`: amount to be minted

`policy-manager.enforce-mint` calls `policy:enforce-mint` in stored token-policies, and the function is executed at `ledger.mint`.

### Burn Token

Token amount is burnt from an account at `burn`. Arguments include:

- `id`: token-id
- `account`: account where the token will be burnt from
- `amount`: amount to be burnt

`policy-manager.enforce-burn` calls `policy:enforce-burn` in stored token-policies, and the function is executed at `ledger.burn`.

### Transfer

Token amount is transferred from sender to receiver at `transfer`. Arguments include:

- `id`: token-id
- `sender`: sender account
- `receiver`: receiver account
- `amount`: amount to be transferred

`policy-manager.enforce-transfer` calls `policy:enforce-transfer` in stored token-policies, and the function is executed at `ledger.transfer`.

### Sale

`sale` allows a two-step offer - buy escrow system using [defpact](https://pact-language.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pact-reference.html#defpact). Arguments include:

- `id`: token-id
- `seller`: seller account
- `amount`: amount to be sold
- `timeout`: timeout of the offer

#### Offer

Step 0 of `sale` executes `offer`. `offer` transfers the token from the seller to the escrow account.

`policy-manager.enforce-offer` calls `policy:enforce-offer` in stored token-policies, and the function is executed at step 0 of `sale`.

#### Withdraw (cont)

Step 0-rollback executes `withdraw`. `withdraw` transfers token from the escrow back to the seller. `withdraw` can be executed after timeout, by sending in `cont` command with `rollback: true`, `step: 0`. Formatting `cont` commands can be read in [here](https://pact-language.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pact-reference.html?highlight=continuation#yaml-continuation-command-request)

`policy-manager.enforce-withdraw` calls `policy:enforce-withdraw` in stored token-policies, and the function is executed at step 0-rollback of `sale`.

#### Buy (cont)

Step 1 executes `buy`. `buy` transfers token from the escrow to the buyer. `buy` can be executed before `timeout`. The `buyer` and `buyer-guard` information is read from the `env-data` of the command instead of passing in arguments. Just like `withdraw`, `buy` is executed using `cont` command with `rollback:false`, `step: 0`.

`policy-manager.enforce-buy` calls `policy:enforce-buy` in stored token-policies, and the function is executed at step 1 of `sale`.

## Policies

Marmalade Policies allow customised rules for token operations.

### Marmalade v2 metadata standard

## Overview

With marmalade V2, the **on-chain** metadata schema for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has been deprecated. This means that the manifest schema, which was previously used to store the metadata for NFTs on-chain, is no longer being used. Instead, a new schema has been introduced, which is off-chain and conforms to the widely accepted standard for NFT metadata.

    (defschema token-schema
        manifest:object{manifest}
    )

Has been replaced with:

    (defschema token-schema
        uri:string
    )

Token schema now has the following structure:

    (defschema token-schema
    	id:string
    	uri:string
    	precision:integer
    	supply:decimal
    	policy:module{kip.token-policy-v2}
    )

- uri: A string representing the URI that points to an external JSON-Schema for the NFT.

## Off-chain Schema

The off-chain schema contains properties that describe the metadata of an NFT stored off-chain in a JSON format. The schema includes the following fields:

| **Field Name**  |  **Data Type**   |                                                                                                                           **Description**                                                                                                                           |

Each author is an object with a "name" field specifying the author's name.                                                               |

## Generating t:{hash}

The previous schema used by Marmalade V1 was called 'manifest', and it consisted of a URI, a hash value, and an array of data objects. To create a new manifest, the 'create-manifest' function was used, which took a URI object and an array of data objects as input. The 'create-datum' function was used to create a data object, which consisted of a URI object and a datum object. The 'verify-manifest' function was used to verify that a given manifest was valid, and the 'enforce-verify-manifest' function was used to enforce the validity of a manifest.

    (defschema token-details
    	uri:string
    	precision:integer
    	policy:module{kip.token-policy-v2}
    )

Since **onchain** manifest is deprecated, token-details schema is hashed.

The reason for hashing the token-details is to capture all the data on the ledger for cross-chain data. Previously, the manifest was hashed to create a unique identifier for each NFT, but now the token-details schema is hashed to create a unique identifier for each NFT.

###

## Rationale

### Why the Manifest was Replaced by URI

We decided to replace the manifest schema with a URI-based schema. The new schema for NFT metadata is a simple JSON schema that describes the properties of the metadata. This schema enables compatibility with various marketplaces and wallets, making Marmalade tokens more interoperable. By utilising a URI-based schema, Marmalade tokens can improve scalability, and provide greater flexibility for developers and most of all simplicity of usage in general.

The decision to move NFT metadata off-chain and use a widely accepted standard for the metadata schema is a positive step for Marmalade tokens.

## IPFS Storage Guide

This guide provides our recommend approach to storing metadata and image assets on IPFS, leveraging hypothetical paths and CIDs. Our manual illustrates two distinctive storage scenarios and outlines the method for accessing stored data.

### Storing Collections: Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Image Upload to IPFS:**

    - Uploading your image assets folder to IPFS, adopting sequential numbering for streamlined referencing (e.g., "1.jpg, 2.jpg...").

2.  **Metadata Update:**

    - After the upload, capture the CID for the assets folder (e.g., "Bayfol...").
    - Proceed to update the metadata files, correlating the image property with the path to CID (e.g., "ipfs://Bayfol.../1.jpg").

3.  **Metadata Upload to IPFS:**

    - Upload the metadata files to IPFS, maintaining sequential numbering that corresponds with the asset (e.g., "1.json, 2.json...").
    - Retrieve the CID for the uploaded metadata folder (e.g., "Baymetx...).

4.  **Finalizing URI:**

    - Merge the metadata folder CID (e.g., "Baymetx...") with the respective filename and extension to construct a comprehensive URI (e.g., "ipfs://Baymetx.../1.json").

### Example:

- **uri:** [ipfs://bafybeig4ihtm2phax2eodfpubwy467szuiieqafkoywp5khzt6cz2hqrna/1.json](ipfs://bafybeig4ihtm2phax2eodfpubwy467szuiieqafkoywp5khzt6cz2hqrna/1.json)

- **gateway:** [[click here]](https://bafybeig4ihtm2phax2eodfpubwy467szuiieqafkoywp5khzt6cz2hqrna.ipfs.dweb.link/1.json)

* **collection-asset-folder:** ipfs://bafybeie4ktsgx4x3gnpvo2uptngez4cvvqdq75iimpnukvpee2x34yp6jm

- **collection-asset-folder-gateway:** [[click here]](https://bafybeie4ktsgx4x3gnpvo2uptngez4cvvqdq75iimpnukvpee2x34yp6jm.ipfs.dweb.link/)

- **collection-metadata-folder:** ipfs://bafybeig4ihtm2phax2eodfpubwy467szuiieqafkoywp5khzt6cz2hqrna

* **collection-metadata-folder-gateway:** [[click here]](https://bafybeig4ihtm2phax2eodfpubwy467szuiieqafkoywp5khzt6cz2hqrna.ipfs.dweb.link/)

### Single NFT Storage: Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Image and Metadata Upload to IPFS:**

    - Upload the image asset to IPFS.

2.  **Metadata Update:**

    - Upon successful upload, retrieve the CID for the asset (e.g., "Bayfabc...").
    - Revise the metadata files, matching the image property with the path to CID (e.g., "ipfs://Bayfabc.../1.jpg").

3.  **Metadata Upload to IPFS:**
    - Upload the metadata file to IPFS.
4.  **Finalizing URI:**
    - Retrieve the path containing the CID for the uploaded metadata file (e.g., "ipfs://Bayfxyz.../metadata.json")

### Example:

- **uri:** [ipfs://bafyreiainnf575ivbxffep3xqx4d4v2jrpyz4yrggylfp5i7lru7zpfese/metadata.json](ipfs://bafyreiainnf575ivbxffep3xqx4d4v2jrpyz4yrggylfp5i7lru7zpfese/metadata.json)

- **gateway-link:** [[click here]](https://bafyreiainnf575ivbxffep3xqx4d4v2jrpyz4yrggylfp5i7lru7zpfese.ipfs.dweb.link/metadata.json)

### Metadata Structure

Your metadata files should adhere to our JSON schema. The schema provides a structure for your metadata, ensuring that necessary details are present and formatted correctly. This schema can be found within this readme.

In this schema, the `image` property should contain a link to the image on IPFS (as illustrated in the previous examples).

### Token Creation in the Ledger

When creating a token in the ledger, you should use the `create-token` function. The link obtained from IPFS (.json) serves as the URI supplied to create a token within the ledger:

    (defun create-token:bool
        ( id:string
          precision:integer
          uri:string
          policies:object{token-policies}
        )
        ...
    )

Please be reminded that these CIDs are hypothetical and should be tailored to match your specific use case and IPFS setup. A thorough understanding of the IPFS storage mechanism is crucial, and the steps should be adjusted as necessary.

By faithfully following these detailed steps, you can efficiently store metadata and image assets on IPFS, associate them with NFTs, and seamlessly retrieve them in your DApp or application.

### URI retrieval from Ledger

Retrieving the URI for a specific token from the ledger is facilitated through a function called `get-uri`. This function requires a token ID as its argument and returns the associated URI.

    (defun get-uri:string (id:string)
      (at 'uri (read tokens id))
    )

When you call the `get-uri` function and pass in a token ID, it will access the `tokens` map, find the row corresponding to the provided token ID, and return the value stored in the `'uri` field of that row. Essentially, it retrieves the URI that corresponds to the token ID you specified.

Thus, by utilising this `get-uri` function, you can efficiently retrieve the URI associated with any token stored within the ledger by simply providing its token ID.
