# Motivation

This KIP proposes that the Kadena ecosystem implement the
[WalletConnect v2 Sign API](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/api/sign). This
API allows for establishing a secure channel for communicating between dApps and
wallets in a platform-agnostic manner.

This is beneficial to Kadena for the following reasons:

- The Kadena ecosystem doesn't have a standard protocol for wallets and dApps to
  communicate with each other.
- The WalletConnect (WC) protocol is tried and
  tested across all devices and it removes the burden of having to maintain a
  Kadena-specific implementation.
- Wallets and dApps that are already using the WC protocol will have an easier
  time integrating with the Kadena ecosystem.
- Kadena's previous Signing API required the wallet to be able to run an http
  server. This is not feasible for some browser-based and mobile wallets.

# Kadena's WalletConnect Specification

This specification is built on top of the
[WalletConnect Specification](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/specs/clients/sign).

## Pairing with WalletConnect

The dApp initiates a pairing with a wallet using WalletConnect as a tunnel.
This is done by sending a so called
[Proposal](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/specs/clients/sign/data-structures#proposal).
This proposal contains the chains, methods, and events the initiator wants to
utilize. The wallet responds with the
[Settlement](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0/specs/clients/sign/data-structures#settlement).
This contains information on which of the requested items it supports.

### Example Pairing Proposal Request and Settlement Response

```jsonc
// Proposal Request
{
  // ... other properties from the WalletConnect Proposal Request
  "requiredNamespaces": {
    "kadena": {
      "chains": ["kadena:mainnet01", "kadena:testnet04", "kadena:development"],
      "methods": [
        "kadena_getAccounts_v1",
        "kadena_sign_v1",
        "kadena_quicksign_v1"
      ],
      "events": []
    }
  }
}
```

```jsonc
// Settlement Response
{
  // ... other properties from the WalletConnect Settlement Response
  "namespaces": {
    "kadena": {
      "accounts": [
        "kadena:mainnet01:38298612cc2d5e841a232bd08413aa5304f9ef3251575ee182345abc3807dd89",
        "kadena:testnet04:38298612cc2d5e841a232bd08413aa5304f9ef3251575ee182345abc3807dd89",
        "kadena:testnet04:22ddc64851718e9d41d98b0f33d5e328ae5bbbbd97aed9885adac0f2d070ff9c"
      ],
      "methods": [
        "kadena_getAccounts_v1",
        "kadena_sign_v1",
        "kadena_quicksign_v1"
      ],
      "events": []
    }
  }
}
```

### WalletConnect Proposal Request

WalletConnect dictates a `requiredNamespaces` property that contains:

1. `requiredNamespaces`: `Object`\
    1.1. `chains`: `Array<string>` - an array of [Chain IDs](#walletconnect-chain-ids) requested.\
    1.2. `methods`: `Array<string>` - an array of [Methods](#walletconnect-methods) requested.\
    1.3. `events`: `Array<string>` - an array of [Events](#walletconnect-events) requested.

### WalletConnect Settlement Response

The response for the Proposal contains a `namespaces` object with the following properties:

1. `namespaces`: `Object`\
    1.1. `accounts`: `Array<string>` - an array of [Accounts](#walletconnect-accounts) availble for signing.\
    1.2. `methods`: `Array<string>` - an array of [Methods](#walletconnect-methods) available.\
    1.3. `events`: `Array<string>` - an array of [Events](#walletconnect-events) available.

## WalletConnect Chain IDs

Chain IDs are WalletConnect’s way of identifying specific blockchains within an ecosystem.

They are defined by the [CAIP-2 standard](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-2.md) and are formatted as:

```
<namespace> + ":" + <reference>
```
- `<namespace>`: `string` - always defined as "kadena".
- `<reference>`: `string` - a unique network ID within the blockchain ecosystem (e.g. `testnet04`, `mainnet01`).

These are valid Chain IDs:

- `kadena:mainnet01` - Kadena mainnet
- `kadena:testnet04` - Current Kadena testnet
- `kadena:development` - Kadena devnet

> **NB**: `Chain IDs`, as defined here, are semantically specific to
> WalletConnect and are not equivalent to a Kadena "Chain ID" (e.g. chain 1).
> They are more closely related to Kadena's `networkId` field.
> We are displaying Kadena `chainId` information in the [`kadena_getAccounts_v1`](#kadena_getAccounts_v1) method.


## WalletConnect Accounts

Accounts are WalletConnect's way of specifying control over signing privileges.

They are defined by the [CAIP-10 standard](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-10.md), and are formatted as:
```
<chain_id> + ":" + <account_address>
```
- `<chain_id>`: `string` - the WalletConnect [Chain ID](#walletconnect-chain-ids).
- `<account_address>`: `string` - the public key available for signing by the wallet.

```jsonc
// WalletConnect Account Example

"kadena:mainnet01:38298612cc2d5e841a232bd08413aa5304f9ef3251575ee182345abc3807dd89"
```

> **NB**: `accounts` is semantically specific to WalletConnect. This does not
> represent an account in a Kadena fungible contract (e.g. `coin`).
> Read the motivation for this in [Accounts vs. Public Keys](#accounts-vs-public-keys).

After the initial pairing with the wallet via WalletConnect, the Kadena accounts relevant for each public key can be requested by calling [getAccounts](#kadena_getaccounts_v1).

The use of account names that can be derived from the public key (i.e. `k:`-accounts that are defined as `k:<public_key>`), is **highly discouraged** as implementing this will limit the end-users flexibility in which account to use, thus making dApps less generic.

## WalletConnect Methods

WalletConnect methods are ways for dApps to interact with a wallet using predefined method identifiers and an optional payload.

The methods available for Kadena are:

- [`kadena_getAccounts_v1`](#kadena_getAccounts_v1)
- [`kadena_quicksign_v1`](#kadena_quicksign_v1)
- [`kadena_sign_v1`](#kadena_sign_v1)

Any additional Kadena method names will be formatted as:
```
kadena_<methodName>_v<methodVersionNumber>
```
- `<methodName>`: `string` - name of the method in camelCase format.
- `<methodVersionNumber>`: `integer` - the version number of the method. Methods are versioned to allow upgradeability

### kadena_getAccounts_v1

This method returns the Kadena account names associated with a given [WalletConnect account](#walletconnect-accounts) and contract(s) on the Kadena blockchain.
#### Example kadena_getAccounts_v1 Request and Response

            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### kadena_getAccounts_v1 Request

This method expects a `method` field that is set to `"kadena_getAccounts_v1"`.

This method also expects a `params` object with the following properties:

1. `params`: `Object`\
    1.1. `accounts`: `Array<Object>`\
    __ 1.1.1 `account`: `string` - a [WalletConnect Account](#walletconnect-accounts) for which the Kadena account names are requested.\
    __ 1.1.2 `contracts`: `Array<string>` (optional) - array of contracts for which the Kadena account name is requested. Returns all known Kadena accounts when omitted.

> **NB**: We choose to not add chains to the [getAccounts_v1 request](#kadena_getAccounts_v1-Request) since it would
> add complexity to the interface. The dApp can filter the necessary chains.

#### kadena_getAccounts_v1 Response

The method response expects a `result` object with the following properties:

1. `result`: `Object`\
    1.1. `accounts`: `Array<Object>`\
    __ 1.1.1 `account`: `string` - the requested [WalletConnect Account](#walletconnect-accounts).\
    __ 1.1.2 `publicKey`: `string` - the requested public key, which was extracted from the WalletConnect account.\
    __ 1.1.3 `kadenaAccounts`: `Array<Object>`\
    ____ 1.1.3.1 `name`: `string` - the account name, as stored in the blockchain, for the specified contract.\
    ____ 1.1.3.2 `contract`: `string` - the contract on which this account name is present.\
    ____ 1.1.3.3 `chains`: `Array<string>` - the chains on which this account name is present.

> **NB**: The accounts that are returned are the ones that are available in the
> scope of the wallet (i.e. only the accounts the wallet knows about).

> **NB**: The same Kadena account name can be used in different contracts
> (e.g. `coin`, `my-fungible`). They require different entries
> since the chains on which the accounts are present can differ.



### kadena_quicksign_v1

QuickSign is part of the [Kadena Signing API](https://github.com/kadena-io/signing-api) and was defined in [kip-0015 (QuickSign Signing API v1)](https://github.com/kadena-io/KIPs/blob/master/kip-0015.md).
This method allows the wallet to show the user multiple transactions that need signature approval.

#### Example kadena_quicksign_v1 Request and Response

```jsonc
// kadena_quicksign_v1 Method Request
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "kadena_quicksign_v1",
  "params": {
    "commandSigDatas": [CommandSigData] // type defined in KIP-15
  }
}
````

```jsonc
// Successful kadena_quicksign_v1 Response
{
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result":  {
      "responses": [Response] // type defined in KIP-15
    }
}
```

or

```jsonc
// Failed kadena_quicksign_v1 Response
{
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result":  {
      "error": QuicksignError // type defined in KIP-15
    }
}

```

#### kadena_quicksign_v1 Request

This method expects a `method` field that is set to `"kadena_quicksign_v1"`.

This method also expects a `params` object with the following properties:

1. `params`: `Object`\
    1.1. `commandSigDatas`: `Array<Object>` - A list of [`CommandSigData`](https://github.com/kadena-io/KIPs/blob/master/kip-0015.md#commandsigdata) to sign.


#### kadena_quicksign_v1 Response

If signing was successful, then the method response expects a `result` object with the following properties:

1. `result`: `Object`\
    1.1. `responses`: `Array<Object>` - A list of [`Response`](https://github.com/kadena-io/KIPs/blob/master/kip-0015.md#response-1) containing the signed transactions.

If signing was **NOT** successful, then the `result` object will contain the following properties:
1. `result`: `Object`\
    1.1. `error`: `Object` - A list of [`QuicksignError`](https://github.com/kadena-io/KIPs/blob/master/kip-0015.md#quicksignerror).

### kadena_sign_v1

Sign is part of the [Kadena Signing API](https://github.com/kadena-io/signing-api). This method allows the wallet to show the user a **single** transaction that needs signature approval.

#### Example kadena_sign_v1 Request and Response

```jsonc
// kadena_sign_v1 Method Request
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "kadena_sign_v1",
  "params": {
    SigningRequest
  }
}
```

```jsonc
// kadena_sign_v1 Response
{
    "id": 1,
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "result":  {
      SigningResponse
    }
}
```

#### kadena_sign_v1 Request

This method expects a `method` field that is set to `"kadena_sign_v1"`.

This method also expects a `params` object with the following properties:

1. `params`: `Object` - A [`SigningRequest`](https://kadena-io.github.io/signing-api/#/definitions/SigningRequest) containing information the wallet needs to create and sign the transaction.

#### kadena_sign_v1 Response

The method response expects a `result` object with the following properties:

1. `result`: `Object` - A [`SigningResponse`](https://kadena-io.github.io/signing-api/#/definitions/SigningResponse) that contains a signed command ready to be submitted to the blockchain.


## WalletConnect Events

At the moment we see no need to standardize any events and believe that most
use cases can be handled at the Kadena protocol level that sits atop Wallet
Connect.

This is subject to change in the future as we understand the workflows more through extended use of the protocol.

However, any future Kadena event names will be formatted as:
```
kadena_<eventName>_v<eventVersionNumber>
```
- `<eventName>`: `string` - name of the event in camelCase format.
- `<eventVersionNumber>`: `integer` - the version number of the event to allow for future upgradeability


# Rationale for the spec

## Accounts vs Public Keys

Several options were considered when discussing what information to include
in the `accounts` section of the initial pairing response.

However, the following reasons forced us to only include the public keys
(prefixed with Kadena's WalletConnect Chain ID):

1. Kadena fungible contracts (specifically the `coin` contract) have a maximum account name length of 256, but
   the [CAIP-10 standard](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-10.md)
   limits WalletConnect account names to a maximum of 128 characters.
2. We considered only supporting `k:` accounts, as they're built from
   `k`:`publicKey`, but we want this response to be generic for all accounts
   that could exist on the Kadena blockchain.

Therefore, we **strongly** advise builders to integrate the [`kadena_getAccounts_v1`](#kadena_getAccounts_v1)
method into the pairing process with the wallet.

This will allow them to support multi-sig accounts (e.g. `w:`-accounts) and
other means of signing transactions.

We do **NOT** recommend extracting the `publicKey` from the WalletConnect account
and just adding a `k:` in front of it.


## SLIP-0044

While not required in the namespace proposal process, a network's SLIP-0044
value is used throughout the WalletConnect demo code.

Kadena's coin type is
**626** as documented in
(SLIP-0044)[https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md].

# Backwards Compatibility

- The `localhost:9467` web-server will be phased out.
- The `/sign` and `/quicksign` endpoints will have their counterparts in the WalletConnect Methods [`kadena_sign_v1`](#kadena_sign_v1) and [`kadena_quicksign_v1`](#kadena_quicksign_v1).
- For wallets that have the local web-server integrated, we suggest they keep this available behind a toggle while they transition to WalletConnect.
