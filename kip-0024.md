## Abstract

The Proposal is to add a new built-in in Pact:

- `pure` to encapsulate and validate that a function call is "Read Only" pure.


## Motivation

The introduction of module references introduced a lot of new possible security flaws.

This has been stated in the official documentation. [1]

Module writers need extreme care when handling modrefs, especially when modrefs are user supplied.

Module writers should consider all the risks and infinite possibilities of re-entrancy, and cheating modules. 

While it is still possible to mitigate these issues by carefully managing capabilities scopes, having a `pure` native helps to add a new layer of defense against an attacker. 

If a module developer assumes that a function call should not have any side effects (*eg:* `fungible-v2::get-balance`), he can enclose it in `(pure )`, 
and will be assured that the callee is not trying to cheat or modify a state somewhere.


## Specification

#### Signature
```
action <a> -> <a>
```
#### Behaviour
```
IF action FAIL => FAIL and propagate the error
IF action performs a non "ReadOnly pure" operation => FAIL
IF action returns a value => RETURN the same value   
```

The behaviour is similar to the existing `(try )` function [2] , but without trying to catch errors.

#### Example
*with the coin contract*

```pact

(pure (coin.get-balance "existing-account"))
  > 3.0

(pure (coin.get-balance "unknown-account"))
  > fails -> Error: with-read: row not found

(pure (coin.create-account "new-account" ks))
  > fails -> Failure: Illegal database access attempt (writeRow)

```

## Backwards Compatibility

Introducing a new native doesn't cause backward compatibility issues.
