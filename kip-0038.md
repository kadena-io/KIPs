# kadena_getAccounts_v2 API

## Abstract

This KIP standardizes the `kadena_getAccounts_v2` method, which enables wallets
to provide a standardized list of accounts they manage. By implementing this
method, decentralized applications (dApps) can retrieve and present to users the
available accounts, allowing users to select the desired account(s) for creating
and signing transactions.

This RPC method allows wallets to return accounts that aren't yet minted
on-chain, but are managed by the wallet. Therefore the guard is on the level of
account name, and not on the level of chain account.

## Motivation

The `kadena_getAccounts_v2` method allows retrieval of all accounts managed by a
wallet along with per fungible and per-chain guard information.

---

## Specification

### Method Definition

**Method Name:** `kadena_getAccounts_v2`

### Request Parameters

No parameters are required.

### Response

The method **MUST** return an array of account objects, even if the wallet only
supports a single account.

Note that the response can have multiple accounts with the same `accountName`.
The `guard` is what makes accounts with the same `accountName` unique. Also accounts on different `contract`s can have the same `accountName`, regardless of the guard.
This allows for dapps to use non-minted accounts. When an account isn't minted, the `chainAccounts` field will be an
empty array.

```typescript
interface AccountInfo {
  accountName: string;
  networkId: string;
  contract: string;
  guard: {
    keys: string[];
    pred: string;
  };
  chainAccounts: string[];
}
```

### Error Responses

In case of failure, the wallet **MUST** return an error object that conforms to
the
[JSON-RPC 2.0 specification](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#error_object).
The error object includes an error code, a message, and optionally additional
data.

```typescript
interface ErrorResponse {
  id: number;
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  error: {
    code: number;
    message: string;
    data?: object;
  };
}
```

#### Error Types

| Code   | Message               |
| ------ | --------------------- |
| -32603 | Internal server error |

### Behavior Requirements

1. **Account Information Retrieval:**

   - **MUST** return accurate and up-to-date information for all accounts
     managed by the wallet.
   - If a wallet supports only a single active account, the method **MUST**
     return an array containing that single account.
   - The returned account information **MUST** include all relevant details as
     defined in the response interface.

2. **Error Handling:**
   - The error response **MUST** conform to the JSON-RPC 2.0 error object
     specification.
   - By default the Internal server error should be used if for any reason account
     information can not be obtained.
   - Custom errors **SHOULD** be used to give more detail about the cause of the error.

## Examples

### Example Request

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "kadena_getAccounts_v2"
}
```

### Example Response: Multiple Accounts over Multiple Networks

This example demonstrates two accounts from the same underlying wallet:

- each account has a different `networkId`: `mainnet01` and `testnet04`
- each account is on a different contract: `coin` and `kdx`

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": [
    {
      "accountName": "k:35d381861d9a6cfb84bef47930b386d1a3b4f3742c8e87772a9e6b43c0e7b5f7",
      "contract": "coin",
      "networkId": "mainnet01",
      "guard": {
        "keys": [
          "35d381861d9a6cfb84bef47930b386d1a3b4f3742c8e87772a9e6b43c0e7b5f7"
        ],
        "pred": "keys-all"
      },
      "chainAccounts": ["5", "8"]
    },
    {
      "accountName": "k:2a6f381861d9a6cfb84bef47930b386d1a3b4f3742c8e87772a9e6b43c0e7b5f8",
      "contract": "kdx",
      "networkId": "testnet04",
      "guard": {
        "keys": [
          "2a6f381861d9a6cfb84bef47930b386d1a3b4f3742c8e87772a9e6b43c0e7b5f8"
        ],
        "pred": "keys-all"
      },
      "chainAccounts": ["0"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example Response: Same Account Name, Different Guards

This account with account name `test` is associated with two different guards across different chains.

- The account is governed by the first guard is on chains `0`, `2`, `3`, and
  `6`.
- The account is governed by the second guard is on chain `1`.

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": [
    {
      "accountName": "test",
      "contract": "coin",
      "networkId": "testnet04",
      "guard": {
        "keys": [
          "c273903d91ad7cc138d54f2a4a3257c8e609f968c217477d6fecda6e399474dd"
        ],
        "pred": "keys-all"
      },
      "chainAccounts": ["0", "2", "3", "6"]
    },
    {
      "accountName": "test",
      "contract": "coin",
      "networkId": "testnet04",
      "guard": {
        "keys": [
          "d34ca0d266193f6163748dbda2003b8147948b5ef720d08c1aed4adb805a7340"
        ],
        "pred": "keys-all"
      },
      "chainAccounts": ["1"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example response: Non-minted (multi-sig) account

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": [
    {
      "accountName": "w:some-account:keys-any",
      "contract": "coin",
      "networkId": "mainnet01",
      "guard": {
        "keys": [
          "35d381861d9a6cfb84bef47930b386d1a3b4f3742c8e87772a9e6b43c0e7b5f7",
          "0sr9t8al0r9ts0a9wflt0nawf9t0aw9fn4t0a8nw0t9nea0w8nft0a9awuflt08n"
        ],
        "pred": "keys-any"
      },
      "chainAccounts": []
    }
  ]
}
```

### Error Response Examples

#### Internal Server Error

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "error": {
    "code": -32603,
    "message": "Internal server error"
  }
}
```

#### Account Not Found / No Account Information Available

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "error": {
    "code": -32008,
    "message": "No account information available"
  }
}
```

## Backwards Compatibility

- **Legacy Methods:** Wallets **MAY** support older methods for retrieving
  account information alongside `kadena_getAccounts_v2`. Legacy methods **MUST**
  be documented as deprecated and phased out over time.
- **Configuration Consistency:** Implementations **MUST** ensure that the
  returned account information matches the wallet's stored configuration.

## Security Considerations

- **Data Accuracy:** Ensure that the returned account information is accurate
  and verified.
- **Error Handling:** Clear error messages must be provided to avoid
  misinterpretation and to assist developers in debugging issues related to
  account retrieval.

## Differences with kadena_getAccounts_v1

`kadena_getAccounts_v1` was proposed to solve a need related to wallet connect, it's able to ask wallets for accounts related to certain public keys. This falls short of dApps their needs to retrieve all accounts a wallet manages, as well as provide these accounts their guards. `kadena_getAccounts_v2` is proposed to solve these shortcomings and deprecate the public key parameter.
