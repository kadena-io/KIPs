(Note: **KIP-0033: Lightweight Confirmation Layer** has top priority. Without it, scaling systems might avoid building on Kadena and instead opt for conventional Web2 approaches. While I am unsure about Kadena's development capacity and workload, if resources are available, please consider reviewing this proposal.)

# KIP-0034: Include WebRTC WebSocket/Signal Server in Chainweb Node (Prepare for WalletConnect Replacement)

---

## Summary
This proposal suggests adding a WebRTC endpoint to Chainweb nodes for text-based communication. The goal is to distribute workload, improve efficiency, and replace the WalletConnect approach. The WebRTC WebSocket would establish peer-to-peer connections between browser-based dApps (local users) and wallets (local) for secure text-only communication. 

The Chainweb node would handle and validate the initial connection setup only, enhancing privacy and enabling large-scale transaction data sharing directly between peers, bypassing relay servers.

---

## Motivation
In light of the company behind WalletConnect renaming itself to Reown, the inefficiencies in the messaging process, heavily limited message sizes due to server involvement, and the introduction of a coin to pay for their (unnecessary) relay service that will be imposed on wallets and users in the future, a WebRTC proof-of-concept (PoC) was developed to assess its feasibility.

However, we believe there may be significant advantages in offloading the peer-to-peer connection establishment to Chainweb nodes. Kadena nodes could leverage their expertise in message validation to enhance the efficiency and reliability of local peer connections.

---

## Specification

### **Wish**
- Keep peers local through a simple JavaScript library that runs directly in the browser, rather than requiring an npm client, to maximize customization and minimize size.

---

### **1. WebRTC Endpoint Integration in Chainweb Node**
- Add a lightweight WebRTC signaling service to Chainweb nodes with the following responsibilities:
  - Handle signaling messages for establishing WebRTC connections between peers.
  - (Validate connection requests and facilitate the initial exchange of offer/answer data.) - if not offloaded to peers
  - Manage registration teardown when peers disconnect, connect, or time out.
  - If desired, limit usage to kadena keysets
---

### **2. Peers / Connection Flow**

#### **Signaling Stage**
- **Peer A (dApp, "browser-local user")** registers on the signal server and presents its ID in QR format.
- **Peer B (Wallet)** scans the QR code, registers on the server, retrieves Peer A’s ID, and establishes the connection (automatic offer/answer workflow).  
- Once the WebRTC connection is established, all communication occurs directly between peers, bypassing the node.

---

### **3. Communication Stage**

#### **Prerequisites**
- Limit scope to **text-based messages only** for simplicity and reduced overhead.
- Validate all incoming messages to prevent malformed or malicious data.
- Define a standardized message schema for WebRTC signaling, e.g.:  
  ```json
  {
    "type": "offer" | "answer" | "candidate",
    "payload": {
      "sdp": "session description protocol data",
      "candidate": "optional candidate information"
    },
    "sender": "unique peer ID",
    "secret": "new connection"
  }
- Include Kadena-specific schemas for transaction data (e.g., **"quicksign only"**).
- Allows for customization to support heavy transaction loads on low-end devices.
- Permits custom network implementations.

---

#### **Communication Workflow**
1. **Exchange Unique Secrets**  
   - Peers exchange unique secrets upon their first connection to locally register verified peers.

2. **Allow Incoming Transaction Data**  
   - Enable incoming transaction data and provide responses in the following format:  
     ```json
     
       "kadena": [ /* transactions */ ]
     
     ```

---

#### **Reestablishing Connections** (Fully Local Workflow*)

- The wallet peer has a fixed **unique ID** that can be stored in the browser (local dApp).
- Wallet and dApp exchange **unique secrets** during initial setup.
- Wallet access is available only when opened (otherwise it's not registered):
  - If the wallet is closed, the user is prompted with a message like:  
    *"Please open/reopen your wallet."*
  - The wallet responds only if the dApp's secret is on its allowlist.
- The signal server supports handling spam and malicious activity mitigation.

---

### **4. Privacy and Security**
- Protect user privacy during the signaling process:
  - Encrypt signaling messages using **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**.
  - (Require wallets to authenticate their identities (e.g., using wallet signatures).) - if exchanged secrets are not sufficient
  - Restrict the Chainweb node's role to building inital peer connections & spam mitigation:
    - Relaying messages (offer/answer).
    - Validating messages (offer/answer).
  - This reduces the attack surface.

---

### **5. Performance and Scalability**
- Optimize the signaling process to support high volumes of simultaneous connection requests:
  - Implement **rate limiting** and **prioritization** to prevent abuse.
  - Use lightweight data structures to manage peer connections efficiently.

---

### **6. Advantages Over WalletConnect**
- Eliminate reliance on centralized relay servers:
  - Reduces operational costs.
  - Improves scalability.
- Enable support for larger transaction data payloads:
  - Leverage direct peer-to-peer communication.
- Enhance privacy:
  - Avoid unnecessary server involvement in message exchange.
- Provide a lightweight alternative:
  - Avoid bulky clients like WalletConnect’s 200MB+ packages for simple operations.

---

### **7. Clarification on Development Priorities**
- While leveraging Chainweb node functionality for this proposal, **this shall not deter the release of current developments.**
- The implementation of a WebRTC endpoint should be treated as a parallel enhancement, aligning with the roadmap without disrupting ongoing priorities.
