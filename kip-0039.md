# Abstract

We propose the `kda_getNetworks` method to provide a list of networks known by the wallet. This allows dApps to present the user with a list of available networks and allow them to select one, as well as the ability to submit transactions on these wallet defined networks.

# kda_getNetworks

Network interface

```ts
interface NetworkInfo {
  name: string;
  networkId: string;
  url?: string;
}
```

## Example request

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "kda_getNetworks",
  "params": {}
}
```

## Example response

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": [
    {
      "name": "kadena:mainnet01",
      "networkId": "mainnet01",
      "url": "https://api.chainweb.com/chainweb/0.0/mainnet01/chain/0"
    },
    {
