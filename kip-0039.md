# kadena_getNetwork_v1 API

## Abstract

This KIP standardizes the `kadena_getNetwork_v1` method for retrieving
information about the **currently active network** from a Kadena wallet. The
method provides consistent network details to dApps, ensuring they can correctly
adjust to the appropriate blockchain environment.

## Motivation

A uniform approach to obtaining network information simplifies dApp development
by ensuring that network details are provided in a consistent format across
different wallet implementations. This standardization will:

- Provide reliable network details (such as network name and networkId) to
  dApps.
- Simplify integration and reduce potential mismatches between wallet and dApp
  network settings.
- Enhance the overall user experience by ensuring clear network context.

The wallet will also return a list of endpoint URLs for the active network. The dApp can use these URLs to make `/local` calls to the network.

The wallet returns only the host. The dApp needs to append the `networkId` and `chainId` to the URL to be able to communicate with the network.

Example:

- Wallet returns: https://api.testnet.chainweb.com
- Dapp can send requests to:
  https://api.testnet.chainweb.com/chainweb/0.0/testnet04/chain/19/pact/api/v1/local

## Specification

### Method Definition

**Method Name:** `kadena_getNetwork_v1`

### Response

The method returns a `NetworkInfo` object containing details about the active
network:

```typescript
interface NetworkInfo {
  networkName: string; // The display name of the network (e.g., "mainnet").
  networkId: string; // The unique identifier for the network (e.g., "mainnet01").
  urls: string[]; // Optional: The root endpoint URL(s) of the network.
}
```

Network urls should be the base URL for sending commands (e.g., "https://api.chainweb.com") rather than the full command path. Placeholders for chainId should be managed by the client.

The wallet might not want to expose the endpoint to the dApp. In that case the
wallet can return an empty array.

### Error Responses

In case of failure, the wallet MUST return an error according to the
[jsonrpc spec](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#error_object) which
represent the following type:

```typescript
interface ErrorResponse {
  id: number;
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  error: {
    code: number;
    message: string;
    data?: object;
  };
}
```

### Error types

| Code   | Message               |
| ------ | --------------------- |
| -32603 | Internal server error |

### Behavior Requirements

1. **Network Information Retrieval:**
   - **MUST** return accurate and up-to-date information about the currently active
     network.
   - **MUST** support all networks that the wallet is configured to operate with.
2. **Error Handling:**
   - The error response **MUST** conform to the JSON-RPC 2.0 error object
     specification.
   - By default the Internal server error should be used if for any reason network
     information can not be obtained.
   - Custom errors **SHOULD** be used to give more detail about the cause of the error.

# Examples

## Basic Get Network Request

### Request

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "kadena_getNetwork_v1"
}
```

### Success Response

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "networkName": "mainnet",
    "networkId": "mainnet01",
    "urls": ["https://api.chainweb.com"]
  }
}
```

## Error Response Example

### Error Response

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "error": {
    "code": -32603,
    "message": "Internal server error"
  }
}
```

## Backwards Compatibility

- Legacy Methods: Wallets MAY support older methods for retrieving network
  information alongside kadena_getNetwork_v1. Legacy methods MUST be documented
  as deprecated and phased out over time.

- Configuration Consistency: Implementations MUST ensure that the returned
  network information matches the walletâ€™s active configuration.

## Security Considerations

- Data Accuracy: Ensure that the returned network information is accurate and
  verified.
