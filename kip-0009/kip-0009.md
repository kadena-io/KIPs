## Abstract

Define and implement a Pact interface to specify restrictions on transfer of a fungible token.

## Motivation

As seen in ERC-1404, certain use cases require restriction of transfer of a fungible token. This
interface is modeled closely on ERC-1404 as an open-ended "descriptive" API that implies the
restriction must be honored in `transfer` and related functions.

## Rationale

### One function to rule them all

The only particularity worth mentioning is the simplification from ERC-1404 from two functions to
one. There is no need for a descriptive function as the equivalent of `detectTransferRestriction`
can return a `string` in Pact (Solidity lacks mechanisms for string comparison), and the lack of
a standard on what integer values in ERC-1404 might mean.

### Specific to `fungible-v1`

As opposed to a generic `restricted-v1`, that could e.g. apply to non-fungible tokens like KIP-0008/`non-fungible-v1`,
this follows ERC-1404 closely in including the _amount_ in the restriction API, as opposed to focusing
only on accounts. This makes it incompatible with `non-fungible-v1` which uses a `string` identifier
for NFTs.

Note that Pact is a "mixin" language, so there is no concept of this "extending" `fungible-v2`. Instead,
implementing fungibles will implement _both_ `fungible-v2` and `restricted-fungible-v1`.


## Backwards Compatibility

This presents no conflicts with its intended interop with `fungible-v2` (or `fungible-v1`).

## Specification

- Interface: [restricted-fungible-v1.pact](pact/restricted-fungible-v1.pact)
- Reference implementation: [restricted-fungible-v1-reference.pact](pact/restricted-fungible-v1-reference.pact)
- Test: [restricted-fungible-v1.repl](pact/restricted-fungible-v1.repl)
