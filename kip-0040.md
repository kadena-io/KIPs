# Abstract

We propose the `kda_getNetwork` method to provide the active network in the wallet. This allows dApps to know what network the user is currently using. This is important for when a wallet restricts transaction signing only to the active network.

# kda_getNetwork

Network interface

```ts
interface NetworkInfo {
  name: string;
  networkId: string;
  url?: string;
}
```

## Example request

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "kda_getNetwork",
  "params": {}
}
```

## Example response

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "name": "kadena:mainnet01",
    "networkId": "mainnet01",
    "url": "https://api.chainweb.com/chainweb/0.0/mainnet01/chain/0"
  }
}
```
