# kadena_getNetworks_v1 API

## Abstract

This KIP standardizes the `kadena_getNetworks_v1` method to provide a list of networks known by the wallet. This allows dApps to present the user with a list of available networks and allow them to select one, as well as the ability to submit transactions on these wallet defined networks.

## Specification

### Method Definition

**Method Name:** `kadena_getNetworks_v1`

### Response

The method returns an Array of `NetworkInfo` objects, containing details about the active networks:

```ts
interface NetworkInfo {
  networkName: string // The display name of the network (e.g., "mainnet").
  networkId: string // The unique identifier for the network (e.g., "mainnet01").
  url?: string | string[] // Optional: The root endpoint URL(s) of the network. This should be the base URL for sending commands (e.g., "https://api.chainweb.com") rather than the full command path. Placeholders for chainId should be managed by the client.
}
```

### Error Responses

In case of failure, the wallet MUST return an error according to the [jsonrpc spec](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#error_object) which represent the following type:

```typescript
interface ErrorResponse {
  id: number
  jsonrpc: '2.0'
  error: {
    code: number
    message: string
    data?: object
  }
}
```

### Error types

| Code   | Message               |
| ------ | --------------------- |
| -32603 | Internal server error |

### Behavior Requirements

1. Network Information Retrieval:

   - MUST return accurate and up-to-date information about the currently active network.
   - MUST support all networks that the wallet is configured to operate with.

2. Error Handling:
   - MUST return a clear error if network information cannot be retrieved due to configuration issues or unsupported networks.

# Examples

## Request

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "kadena_getNetworks_v1"
}
```

## Success Response

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": [
    {
      "networkName": "mainnet",
      "networkId": "mainnet01",
      "url": "https://api.chainweb.com"
    },
    {
      "networkName": "Testnet",
      "networkId": "testnet04",
      "url": ["https://api.chainweb.com", "https://api.xx"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Error Response Example

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "error": {
    "code": -32603,
    "message": "Internal server error"
  }
}
```

## Backwards Compatibility

- Legacy Methods: Wallets MAY support older methods for retrieving network information alongside kadena_getNetwork_v1. Legacy methods MUST be documented as deprecated and phased out over time.

- Configuration Consistency: Implementations MUST ensure that the returned network information matches the walletâ€™s active configuration.

## Security Considerations

- Data Accuracy: Ensure that the returned network information is accurate and verified.
