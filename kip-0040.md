# kadena_getNetwork API

## Abstract

This KIP standardizes the `kadena_getNetwork` method for retrieving information about the currently active network from a Kadena wallet. The method provides consistent network details to dApps, ensuring they can correctly adjust to the appropriate blockchain environment.

## Motivation

A uniform approach to obtaining network information simplifies dApp development by ensuring that network details are provided in a consistent format across different wallet implementations. This standardization will:

- Provide reliable network details (such as network name and networkId) to dApps.
- Simplify integration and reduce potential mismatches between wallet and dApp network settings.
- Enhance the overall user experience by ensuring clear network context.

## Specification

### Method Definition

**Method Name:** `kadena_getNetwork`

### Request Parameters

````typescript
interface GetNetworkRequest {
  // No parameters are required for this method.
}

Response

The method returns a NetworkInfo object containing details about the active network:

interface NetworkInfo {
  name: string;        // The human-readable name of the network.
  networkId: string;   // The unique identifier for the network (e.g., "mainnet01").
  url?: string;        // Optional: The network endpoint URL.
}

Error Responses

If retrieval of network information fails, the wallet MUST return an error in the following structure:

```typescript
{
  "error": {
    "type": "networkUnavailable | other",
    "msg": string | null
  }
}
````

Behavior Requirements

1. Network Information Retrieval:
   • MUST return accurate and up-to-date information about the currently active network.
   • MUST support all networks that the wallet is configured to operate with.

2. Event Emission:
   • SHOULD emit a kadena_networkChanged event when there is a change in the active network.

3. Error Handling:
   • MUST return a clear error if network information cannot be retrieved due to configuration issues or unsupported networks.

# Examples

## Basic Get Network Request

### Request

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "kda_getNetwork",
  "params": {}
}
```

### Success Response

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "name": "kadena:mainnet01",
    "networkId": "mainnet01",
    "url": "https://api.chainweb.com/chainweb/0.0/mainnet01/chain/0"
  }
}
```

## Error Response Example

### Error Response

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "networkUnavailable",
    "msg": "The network information could not be retrieved."
  }
}
```

Backwards Compatibility
• Legacy Methods: Wallets MAY support older methods for retrieving network information alongside kadena_getNetwork. Legacy methods MUST be documented as deprecated and phased out over time.
• Configuration Consistency: Implementations MUST ensure that the returned network information matches the wallet’s active configuration.

Security Considerations
• Data Accuracy: Ensure that the returned network information is accurate and verified.
• Event Notification: Emit network change events to keep dApps updated and prevent configuration mismatches.
