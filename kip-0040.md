# kadena_getNetworks_v1 API

## Abstract

This KIP standardizes the `kadena_getNetworks_v1` method to provide a list of networks known by the wallet. This allows dApps to present the user with a list of available networks and allow them to select one, as well as the ability to submit transactions on these wallet defined networks.

The dapp can use the URL to make /local calls from the network.

The wallet returns only the host. The dapp should append networkId and chainId
to the URL.

Example:

- Wallet returns: https://api.testnet.chainweb.com
- Dapp can send requests to:
  https://api.testnet.chainweb.com/chainweb/0.0/testnet04/chain/19/pact/api/v1/local

## Specification

### Method Definition

**Method Name:** `kadena_getNetworks_v1`

### Response

The method returns an Array of `NetworkInfo` objects, containing details about the active networks:

```ts
interface NetworkInfo {
  networkName: string; // The display name of the network (e.g., "mainnet").
  networkId: string; // The unique identifier for the network (e.g., "mainnet01").
  urls: string[]; // Optional: The root endpoint URL(s) of the network.
}
```

Network urls should be the base URL for sending commands (e.g., "https://api.chainweb.com") rather than the full command path. Placeholders for chainId should be managed by the client.

If the wallet implementation chooses not to expose the network endpoint, it MUST return an empty array for the `url` field.

### Error Responses

In case of failure, the wallet MUST return an error according to the [jsonrpc spec](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#error_object) which represent the following type:

```typescript
interface ErrorResponse {
  id: number;
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  error: {
    code: number;
    message: string;
    data?: object;
  };
}
```

### Error types

| Code   | Message               |
| ------ | --------------------- |
| -32603 | Internal server error |

### Behavior Requirements

1. **Network Information Retrieval:**
   - **MUST** return accurate and up-to-date information about the currently active network.
   - **MUST** support all networks that the wallet is configured to operate with.
2. **Error Handling:**
   - The error response **MUST** conform to the JSON-RPC 2.0 error object
     specification.
   - By default the Internal server error should be used if for any reason network
     information can not be obtained.
   - Custom errors **SHOULD** be used to give more detail about the cause of the error.

# Examples

## Request

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "kadena_getNetworks_v1"
}
```

## Success Response

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": [
    {
      "networkName": "mainnet",
      "networkId": "mainnet01",
      "urls": ["https://api.chainweb.com"]
    },
    {
      "networkName": "Testnet",
      "networkId": "testnet04",
      "urls": ["https://api.chainweb.com", "https://api.domain.io"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Error Response Example

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "error": {
    "code": -32603,
    "message": "Internal server error"
  }
}
```

## Backwards Compatibility

- Legacy Methods: Wallets MAY support older methods for retrieving network information alongside kadena_getNetwork_v1. Legacy methods MUST be documented as deprecated and phased out over time.

- Configuration Consistency: Implementations MUST ensure that the returned network information matches the walletâ€™s active configuration.

## Security Considerations

- Data Accuracy: Ensure that the returned network information is accurate and verified.
