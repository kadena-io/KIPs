# kadena_getAccount_v1 API

## Abstract

We propose the `kadena_getAccount_v1` method to provide an active account known by the wallet. This allows dApps to present the user with the selected account and allow them to use it for creating and signing transactions.

## Motivation

The `kadena_getAccount_v1` method provides a standardized way to retrieve a list of accounts from a Kadena wallet.

## Specification

### Method Definition

**Method Name:** `kadena_getAccount_v1`

### Request Parameters

```typescript
interface GetAccountRequest {
  account?: {
    publicKey: string;
    contract: string;
  };
}
```

### Response

```typescript
interface AccountInfo {
  accountName: string;
  fungibleContract: string;
  chainAccounts?: Array<{
    chainId: ChainId;
    guard: {
      keys: string[];
      pred: string;
    };
  }>;
}
```

### Error Responses

In case of failure, the wallet MUST return an error according to the [jsonrpc spec](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#error_object) which represent the following type:

```typescript
interface ErrorResponse {
  id: number;
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  error: {
    code: number;
    message: string;
    data?: object;
  };
}
```

### Error types

| Code   | Message               |
| ------ | --------------------- |
| -32603 | Internal server error |

### Behavior Requirements

1. Account Information Retrieval:
   • MUST return accurate and up-to-date information about the active active account.

2. Event Emission:
   • SHOULD emit a kadena_accountChanged event when there is a change in the active account.

3. Error Handling:
   • MUST return a clear error if account information cannot be retrieved due to configuration issues or unsupported networks.

# Examples

### Example request

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "kadena_getAccount_v1",
  "params": {}
}
```

### Example response

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "accountName": "k:35d381861d9a6cfb84bef47930b386d1a3b4f3742c8e87772a9e6b43c0e7b5f7",
    "fungibleContract": "coin",
    "chainAccounts": [
      {
        "chainId": "0",
        "guard": {
          "keys": [
            "35d381861d9a6cfb84bef47930b386d1a3b4f3742c8e87772a9e6b43c0e7b5f7"
          ],
          "pred": "keys-all"
        }
      },
      {
        "chainId": "1",
        "guard": {
          "keys": [
            "35d381861d9a6cfb84bef47930b386d1a3b4f3742c8e87772a9e6b43c0e7b5f7"
          ],
          "pred": "keys-all"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Error Response

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "error": {
    "code": -32603,
    "message": "Internal server error"
  }
}
```

### Response details

Accounts should be returned per fungible contract, if the wallet knows about multiple fungibles held by one account then return the account for each one.

If a wallet only works with single accounts, this method should return a single account.

### Request by public key

kip-0017 defines kadena_getAccounts_v1, which uses a public key received from walletconnect to retrieve accounts.

## Example request by public key

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "kadena_getAccount_v1",
  "params": {
    "accounts": {
      "publicKey": "60870392901728fe6bb773534d71272d0851b587cb91cb859a303b20f1025069",
      "contract": "coin"
    }
  }
}
```

## Example response by public key

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "accountName": "w:Gkx0oHalSq0TpNQjx7Q4UTgZteaQ1QwnBH3hR60VCuY:keys-all",
    "fungibleContract": "coin",
    "chainAccounts": [
      {
        "chainId": "0",
        "guard": {
          "keys": [
            "60870392901728fe6bb773534d71272d0851b587cb91cb859a303b20f1025069",
            "49a7943c8a29962d81142067da4f4fa98940fee89efc4780b86adef9546b493a"
          ],
          "pred": "keys-all"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Backwards Compatibility

• Legacy Methods: Wallets MAY support older methods for retrieving account information alongside kadena_getAccounts_v1. Legacy methods MUST be documented as deprecated and phased out over time.
• Configuration Consistency: Implementations MUST ensure that the returned account information matches the wallet’s active configuration.

## Security Considerations

• Data Accuracy: Ensure that the returned account information is accurate and verified.
• Event Notification: Emit account change events to keep dApps updated and prevent configuration mismatches.
